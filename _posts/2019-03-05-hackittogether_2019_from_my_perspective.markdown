Browsing through Learn Slack channels, I saw a fellow NY student post about an all-women Hackathon taking place in [Lander College For Women](https://lcw.touro.edu/) in the upcoming days, and I said to myself, *"Hey, why not?"*.  I proceeded to save my spot and joined the Flatiron group that had already done the same, Aellon, Paula, Robin and Indy, and we formed our team!

March 3rd came, and once we got to the Hackathon we learned that none of the ideas we had in mind to possibly work on could be implemented, since they did not fall into the categories listed for the event.

Among the challenges presented, we decided to work on the one proposed by JetBlue, which required creating a product that demonstrates how it is the most caring airline in the world.  We took the word "caring" very literaly, and we wanted to present a prototype that showed JetBlue not only cared about its customers, but the entire world, which is why we decided to build an interface that allows users to be matched with available volunteering opportunities in their desired destinations, in exchange for TrueBlue points or ticket discounts. 

As the day went by, a very motivating and attitude-shifting speech was given by the keynote speaker, Google's Senior Engineering Program Manager, [Katy Kasmai](http://katykasmai.com/).  Her talk revolved around "Building Moonshots to Solve Our Greatest Challenges", and was definitely one of my favorite parts of the entire day.

Back to our project, we achieved a preliminary model to present to the judges by using Ruby on Rails to create the application, Nokogiri to scrape the [International Voluteer HQ](https://www.volunteerhq.org/volunteer-abroad-programs/) website for the volunteering programs, and Bootstrap for designing the pages.

We were called first out of 22 teams with awesome ideas, and we were nervious!  We presented our project surpassing a few technical difficulties.  Eventhough the main purpose for our participation was to learn and have fun, we definitely wanted to be able to create something innovative, useful and that could make a positive impact in the world.

We were incredibly happy to learn the judges chose us as the JetBlue's Challenge winners, not only because of the awesome prize, but because they were able to see what we saw behind our idea, not just in its implementation.  We were happy to know that ideas to help those in need are winning ideas.
