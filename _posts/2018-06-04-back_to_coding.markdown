The tittle of this post is totally misleading, read along and see why.

Hi! My name is Wendy Calder√≥n, a mom of two very little ones, who decided to go back to school after 10 long years.  The first time I wrote any lines of code was in my college years, over a decade ago; after I graduated, I worked in the tech field for 5 years, nothing code related; I was a System Admin, part of the Hardware Department.  But now that I'm almost ready to start the job hunt again, I feel captivated by the perks of being a software developer.

So far my journey has had its ups and downs, as expected I guess; there have been days where I've felt like this is what I'm meant to do, and others, not so encouraging.  But as each sleepless night of reading through lessons and working on these Tic Tac Toe labs pass by, I feel like... no, wait, I **know** I'm on the right track.

I've always been a multitasker, which has come in handy learning how to code from scratch (remember, two little -but very active- ones), and when I sit down to work on a lab, I truly enjoy how I start thinking of how the result could possibly be even better.

So here I am, taking baby steps into this *known-but-not-so-well-just-yet* world of coding!
