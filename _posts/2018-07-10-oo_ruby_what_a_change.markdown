The last couple of weeks have been interesting: I've been on a roller coaster of feelings between total frustration and uncontainable exciment. That pretty much sums up my dive into Object Oriented Ruby. 

Procedural Ruby is so literal, I almost miss it, but after these last labs (*Object Labs*), where I've seen myself going from taking 3 days to complete just one, to submitting these three in  just 1 day, I've regained confidence. OO Ruby now feels a lot more readable, logic and clean. 

I have yet to go over a lot more material to entirely grasp the concepts and encapsulations OO Ruby proposes, so my posts can get a little more technical, after all I'm still a newby...
