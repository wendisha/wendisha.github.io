If you ever found two websites of your interest with the exact same content, but different in presentation: one is very plain, *content-oriented* and sort of straight to the point, and the other one is more decorated, with images and colors that lead you to grasp a better feel of the content that's being presented, which one would you choose to keep visiting? Personally, I am a very visual person, who tends to prefer things with a creative look and style. 

Giving any website this attractive presentation is possible thanks to **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS).

In simple words, CSS is a file where we define how we want our website to look like, style wise (best practice is for this file to be different from where our HTML code is). Think of it like entering a house: you see the living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms which compound the actual house, its content, this would be HTML. Now, when you pay close attention to the wall color, how the furniture is arranged, that beautiful paiting to your left or that lava lamp to your right, that would be CSS. Let's keep in mind that all this decorations have no use without the actual house, but we could still visit the house itself, without the paitings, or any of the stuff that makes it prettier. This means that CSS is to be used in HTML, not the other way around.

In my still very early stages of learning how to code, I have a feeling I will enjoy working with CSS quite some, so stay tuned, this entry will probably be updated with CSS facts and a little beautifying!
